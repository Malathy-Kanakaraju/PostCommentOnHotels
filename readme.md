## My first Laravel project

This is my first laravel project that I did to make myself comfortable with the basic handling of laravel tasks.

Completed features:

(1) Create Auth middleware for login and register features

(2) Admin route will enable the user to view list of all hotels.

(3) Any registered user will be able to view list of all hotels.

(4) Upon clicking on any hotel name, the user will be able to see all comments for that hotel saved by differen users.

(4) Any registered user will be able to post a comment for any of the listed hotels.
